[["A", "I can see the goal to the far right. The immediate path is blocked by a wall directly to my right. I plan to jump over this obstacle to advance towards the goal. I recommend that other players also assess their surroundings and move or jump accordingly to progress towards the goal, being mindful of any potential keys, doors, buttons, or lasers that may appear as we move forward."]]
