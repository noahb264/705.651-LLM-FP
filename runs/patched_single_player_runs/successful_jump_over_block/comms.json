[["A", "There are no buttons, keys, doors, or other players visible from my current position. The goal is to the far right, but we're separated by a series of walls directly to my right and above me. There's no direct way to the goal at the moment, so we'll need to explore the board and find necessary items or pathways to the goal. I will start by moving to the right to gather more information about the level."]]
