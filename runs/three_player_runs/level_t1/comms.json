[["A", "It appears we need to collect the key on the left to open the door to the right of P1. P2 is positioned to aid in getting to the key. P3 could help in getting back from the key by creating a platform. I'll move left to make my way towards the key. P2 and P3, please position yourselves to assist in the key retrieval and eventual passage through the door."]]
