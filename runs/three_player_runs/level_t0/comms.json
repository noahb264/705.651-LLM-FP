[["A", "It looks like we need to work together to collect the key to unlock these doors blocking our path to the goal. P2 and P3, if you move right on your turns, P2 will collect the key, eliminating the doors and allowing us to progress towards our goal. Once the path is clear, we can move towards the goal. I'll remain in position this turn to allow you to reach the key."]]
