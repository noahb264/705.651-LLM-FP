[["A", "I see the key to our left and the goal blocked by a door to our far right, so our primary objective is to secure the key which will open the door for us. I'm currently blocked by walls to my right, so I cannot move in that direction. P2, please secure the key on our next turn as you're closest to it. P3 and P4, get into positions to support P2 if necessary, or prepare to advance right towards the goal once the door is open. My plan is to move left and assist with securing the key or clearing the way after the door opens."]]
