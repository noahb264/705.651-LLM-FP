[["A", "The goal and the key are both to our far right, and we need to collect the key to open the door that is directly to my right. P2, P3, and P4, please move to the right on your turns so that on my next turn, I can jump on top of P2 and move towards the key. We'll need to make sure that we stay on top of moving right so we can get to the key and the goal efficiently."]]
