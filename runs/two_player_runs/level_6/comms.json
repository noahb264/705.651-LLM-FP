[["A", "I see we have a couple of laser emitters and buttons on the right. P1 will handle the first button to disable the lasers, allowing P2 to move safely. Once P2 advances, they can do the same at the second button. We do not have visibility of the goal yet, so let's progress to the right and reassess once we have more information."], ["B", "I support P1's plan to handle the first button to disable the lasers. I will prepare to advance and stand by the second button. Once P1 has disabled the first set of lasers, I can move safely to the right and eventually deactivate the second set of lasers. Let's progress step by step and keep an eye out for the goal as we move."]]
