[["A", "I support the plan, as we need to deactivate the lasers to safely reach the goal. P2 is positioned to activate the button, which will turn off the lasers. We should coordinate our moves to ensure I can safely collect the key after the lasers are deactivated. My next move will be to jump over the laser emitter on my left. This will position me closer to the key, so I can collect it as soon as the lasers are turned off by P2. P2, once you press the button, please stay there until I have the key, and P3, get ready to move through the door as soon as it opens."]]
