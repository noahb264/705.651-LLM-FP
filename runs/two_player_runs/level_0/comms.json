[["A", "I see that player P2 is right next to me. I'll move right to start making my way towards the goal, which appears to be on the far right of the board. P2, please follow behind and let's make sure to avoid any obstacles on our path. There's a large wall separating us from the goal, so we'll need to find a way around it."], ["B", "I support P1's plan to move towards the goal on the right. There's no direct path due to the large wall, so we need to find a way around it. Since I'm adjacent to the wall, I cannot move right. P1 has already moved, so on my turn, I'll follow by jumping over P1 to avoid being stuck behind them. This will bring us both closer to the goal and potentially reveal more of the level, helping us determine our next steps."]]
